# Project Root

A simple package to help with resolving paths when working in a composer package.

Specifically, for some functionality you may need to refer to the packages root 
directory, but then need to use the project's root when the package is included 
as a dependency.

Rather than keep repeating dirty logic from before, we can use this package.
